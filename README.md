# High Point Regional HS - TSA Webmaster 2011

## Information
This project is High Point Regional High School's entry to the 2011 Technology Student Association Webmaster Competition. It placed 2nd at the NJ State Conference. Theo Pak will represent the project at the National Conference to be held in Dallas, TX.

The Technology Student Association (TSA) is an international Career and Technical Student Organization composed of over 150 000 Middle School and High School Technology Education students. TSA provides students opportunities to compete, lead, and learn. The organization's motto is "Learning to live in a technical world".

High Point Regional High School is a public high school located in rural Sussex County, NJ where approximately 1 200 students attend from the five municipalities of Branchville, Frankford, Lafayette, Sussex, and Wantage.

## Why Open Source? - message from the project leader
I developed this solution to A) serve High Point TSA's needs, and to B) compete in the national TSA competition. I feel that my final solution is a useful and innovative approach to giving TSA chapters an informative website. I used F/OSS whenever possible, and am proud to contribute to the community. Though it may be counter-intuitive to the competitive nature of TSA, I hope that my solution will be refined by other chapters and future students.

Please feel free to study the way I used the excellent GNU software that already exists and to use my solution in portions or in its entirety. I ask only that you attribute the original authors of each component, and give back to the community with code or suggestions.
