				<h3>High Point Regional High School Technology Education</h3>
				<p>High Point Regional High School’s Technology Education Department prides itself in offering various technological electives to high school students. On the exterior, our department has five classrooms that were all updated in 2001. We have six technology teachers who help in all fields of technology. The department is unique. For most students, it is a treasured place where classmates and teachers strive to conquer technological challenges and goals.</p>
				<p>Our department does not just compete in Technology Student Association conferences. Many teachers have found programs for our students to compete in. Although all of our teachers in the department have different strengths and interests, each one realizes the significance of obtaining real-world opportunities in challenges. Annually, our department has classmates that compete in the Thomas Edison Invention Challenge, Panasonic Creative Design Challenge, and many more. In fact, a team received a patent for solving a real-world problem that received nationwide attention.</p>
				<p>Intrinsically, our department consists of the best staff and students. All of the teachers contribute to the functioning department by committing their expertise and attention to their students. Not all teachers are willing to stay after school so that students can work on their competition projects. Not all teachers challenge their students to new heights. Not all teachers genuinely care for their students. That may be the case, but the Technology Education Department’s teachers are like that. Our technology students are able to be the best because are department is motivating, challenging, and successful.</p>
