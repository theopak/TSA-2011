				<h3>What is Visual Impairment?</h3>
				<p>Those falling victim to falling under the classification of “visual impairment,” have obstacles with tasks that most of us take for granted every single day. Have you ever reflected on the how much our eyes do for us on a daily basis? Some with glasses or contacts may appreciate the gift of eyesight more than those who have been fortunate enough to be foreign to the world of visual impairment problems.</p>
				<h3>Types of Visual Impairments</h3>
				<img class="frame clearfix" src="http://www.nei.nih.gov/CanWeSee/images/NEI_Chart_300dpi.JPG" width="500px" alt="14 million people in the U.S. are visually impaired. Of these, 11 million have visual impairment that CAN be corrected with glasses/contact lenses, 3 million have visual impairments that CANNOT be corrected with glasses/contant lenses." />
				<p>There are multiple types of visual impairment. A few of the common ones are Amblyopia, Retina Pigmentosa, and Retinopathy of Prematurity. Amblyopia is a common eye disorder that is often nicknamed “lazy eye.” One with this condition has weaker eye muscles and the eye with the condition has poor positioning. Although there is surgery to treat this, an effective solution is to try and strengthen the affected eye by placing an eye patch over the other one. By doing so, the lazy eye has to work harder and its muscles can strengthen. Retinitis Pigmentosa is another condition in which a person suffers from a degenerative loss of their peripheral vision. Retinopathy of Prematurity is another common type which involves premature babies. Babies that are born into the world need higher oxygen levels and the eyes scar and detach from parts of the retina at birth.</p>
				<p>Approximately 14 million people in the United States are visually impaired. Three million of that number have conditions in which their visual impairment conditions cannot be corrected by glasses or contact lenses. The diagram below visually shows the statistics.</p>
				<p>The following are tests that a doctor can prescribe, as quoted by <em>TeensHealth</em>:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Visual Acuity Test</strong> - A person reads an eye chart to measure how well he or 	she sees at various distances.</li>
					<li><strong>Visual Field Test</strong> - Ophthalmologists use this test to measure side, or peripheral, vision.</li>
					<li><strong>Tonometry Test</strong> - This test determines the fluid pressure inside the eye to evaluate for glaucoma.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The National Eye Institute indicates that 14 million Americans are visually impaired to some degree.</p>
