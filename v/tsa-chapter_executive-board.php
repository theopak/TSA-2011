				<h3>The 2010-2011 High Point TSA Executive Board</h3>
				<img class="frame clearfix" src="/img/board.png" alt="The HP TSA Board" width="500px" />
				<p>Our TSA Executive Board consists of six high school students. Since August, we have been planning fundraisers and trips for our chapter to go on. Our chapter has had a busy TSA year! This year, our chapter has been busy fundraising for both the state and national TSA conferences. We have fundraised through bakes sales, a New Jersey Devil’s game, and we are hosting the 6th Annual TSA 5k on April 2, 2011.</p>
				<p>Although each member on the executive board holds an office, we all share responsibilities in order to make things happen. As our chapter grows, we are finding more ways to communicate TSA agendas and meetings. Five of the six Executive Board members will be attending college next fall, so we will all be looking forward to the state and national TSA conferences this year!</p>
				<h3>President - Emily Slate</h3>
				<p>Hello TSA! My name is Emily Slate and I am High Point’s TSA Chapter President. I am currently a high school senior and have been involved with TSA for four years. Last year, I was our chapter’s Treasurer. Throughout high school, TSA has been my favorite organization. I have dedicated the most time and effort to our school’s chapter. I am graduating from high school this spring and will be embarking on a new journey while studying nursing at Seton Hall University in the fall.</p>
				<h3>Vice President - Diego Cantillano</h3>
				<p>My name is Diego Cantillano and I am Vice President of High Point’s TSA. I have been involved in TSA throughout high school and I have enjoyed working on the Executive Board this year. TSA has provided many opportunities for me and has provided a great amount of experience in the technology field that will help me with my future career. I plan to major in Mechanical Engineering at either Virginia Tech or NJIT next fall. I will miss TSA next year, but I will always remember the experiences it has provided me with.</p>
