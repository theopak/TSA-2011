							===== PRO TIPS: ==============================
							* to make text bold,   use the strong tag.
							  eg "<strong>boldface type</strong>".
							* to make text italic, use the emphasis tag. 
							  eg "<em>italic type</em>".
							  use italics for names of courses.
							* ampersands must be written as "&amp;" 
							  instead of just "&".
							* don't forget to close all tags! 
							  eg "<li></li>" and never just "<li>" 
							  or else bad things will happen.
							* only use a plain text editor (eg Notepad++).
							  never use a program like MS Word.
