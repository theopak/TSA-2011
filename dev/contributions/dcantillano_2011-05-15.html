Introduction
As reported in The Encyclopedia of Blindness and Visual Impairment, "The World Health Organization estimates that there are between 40 million and 45 million blind people in the world, and an additional 120 million suffering from disabling low vision...[and] the number of people who are blind or visually impaired will double by the year 2025."(Sardegna)

Complete Blindness
Complete or Total blindness has been to defined to be a complete loss of light perception(NLP). Individuals who are completely blind are unable to distinguish any changes in light or any movement in front of them.(Sardegna) Complete blindness is the most severe out of all the cases and the difficulties met by those individuals is much greater than those who suffer a more minor case of visual impairment. The aid that totally blind people can receive is limited because of their inability to sense changes in light which restricts only uses aid that interacts with their other senses.

Partial Blindness
Most people with any visual impairment fall into the category of having Low visions which consists of several different types of visual impairment. Many of these individuals fall into a category with "terms including medically blind, legally blind, partially blind, partially seeing, low vision, functionally blind, braille blind, vocationally blind, economically blind, visually defective, visually impaired, visually handicapped and visually disabled."(Sardegna) Legal blindness is a term used by federal entitlement agencies to determine whether or not an individual qualifies for benefits. One may be classified as legally blind if their visual acuity (area of vision) is less than 20/200 in the better of both eyes with correction or if visual field, even with 20/20 vision, is limited to 20 degrees or less. (Sardegna)

Color Blindness
Eyes interpret color through the retina which converts light energy into electric energy that is sent to the brain to be translated into an image. Photoreceptor cells in the retina contain three rods which interpret the three simplest light wavelengths; red, green, and blue. Color blindness occur when one rod is unable to interpret its wavelength correctly. There are many different types of color blindness which limits what colors individuals have trouble seeing. Most individuals who are color blind see some colors but lack the ability to see others; for example, some may see every color but red or green which they see as grey or black. (Sardegna)

Braille
Braille is a "a tactile language made up of a system of raised dots. The reader of braille feels the dots to recognize the letter."(Sardegna) Reading is considered one of the most readily used forms of communication next to speech. A person suffering from visual impairment is able to understand these raised dots by sliding his/her finger overtop of them and understanding them to be letters and words. Braille can be made by using a braille press, which presses thick paper leaving raised dots, or braille printers which can produce the raised dots like a normal printer can print paper.

Octagon
Not all text is converted into braille, but modern science has created the Octagon which is a camera lense that reads normal texts and then the of the user "rests on a console that receives the print and converts it to a series of vibrating pins that simulate print letters."(Sardegna) This increases the amount of things an individual is able to read because it extends to all texts not already converted to braille.(Sardegna)

Household Items
Everyday tasks, like cooking, become nearly impossible without some sort of assistance. Liquid level indicators help visually impaired personnel know when a cup is full after pouring. This clip on device is attached to a cup and will ring when the liquid level raises high enough to activate the sensor.(Sardegna) Flame-less ovens reduce the risk of injury for a "blind" person who cannot judge the activity of a wild flame. "Other aids for the home include self-threading needles, sewing-machine magnifiers, magnetic padlocks (which require no combination and open with a magnetic sensor), raised large-print telephone dials, one-button automatic telephone-dialing systems, and brailled clothing tags."(Sardegna)

Magnifiers
Magnifiers enable those with low vision to see normal texts by magnifying it (sometimes up to 60 times larger) without having to be converted to braille. Many magnifiers are hand held and are simply raised up to the text to aid the reader. Electronic magnifiers consists of a camera and lense which reads the text or the environment in focus and magnifies the image so that the individual can see better.(Sardegna)

Change of Environment
Often times, those suffering from visual impairment are mostly disturbed by lighting fixtures in rooms and the sensitivity to light hinders their ability to see. Customized rooms may increase contrast, dim lights, and reduce reflections of light to provide a more comfortable environment for people to see.(Sardegna)

Check the second paragraph of the visual impairments page. "Those falling victim to falling under the classification of “visual impairment,” " doesnt make sense.....

Screen Readers
Screen readers, also called speech synthesizers, enable people with visual impairment to hear the text that is being presented on a computer screen without having to read it; screen readers take the digital text and a computerized voice will speak to the user. Screen readers are also used as scanners for normal print. When equipped with a scanner, a reader can scan textbooks, books, magazines, and other printed text into the computer and listen as the computer recites the text. The software also works as a method for the input of text; when installed with a word processor, the user can recite words into a microphone that will be turned into digital texts without having to look at a keyboard.
