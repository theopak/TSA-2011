				<h3>Technological Studies <small style="float: right;" onclick="$('ul.info li p').slideToggle();">(view all)</small></h3>
				<ul class="info">
					<li>
						<h4>Biotechnology 1</h4>
						<span>Mr. Wallace</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits - Grades 9-12</small>
						<p>Biotechnology is a distinct technological area of human adaptive behavior. Biotechnology involves the design of techniques and systems utilizing living organisms, or their parts, to accomplish some purposeful goal. Biotechnology is utilized within food production, medical procedures, environmental restoration, and many other aspects of our lives. <br/>Biotechnology uses living cells and materials produced by cells to create pharmaceutical, diagnostic, agricultural, environmental andother products to benefit society. This first of a three -year program of study, will be an introduction to biotechnology systems. Areas touched on may include: bioengineering, healthcare, cultivation of plants and animals, fuel and chemical production, waste management and treatment, biotechnological materials and application.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Communication Technology</h4>
						<span>Mr. Wallace</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits - Grades 9-12</small>
						<p>This course will introduce students to the systems of communication. Areas of study include video game design, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), electronics, fiber optics, and other systems. The IT field is booming and students need a basic understanding of communication technology.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Engineering &amp; Design Technology 1</h4>
						<span>Mr. Peltier / Mr. Potzer</span>
						<small>CPA - 2.5 Credits - Grades 9-12</small>
						<p>This semester course emphasizes the application of the design method to invent solutions to real world technological problems. Students will identify problems, use internet research, and design and fabricate models or prototype solutions. Problem solving and design skills are taught through a variety of activities. Hands-on themes for this level include, but are not limited to, structural, fluid powered, and robotic systems. This course provides all students with valuable skills such as: problem solving, design, creative thinking, systems thinking, team work, documentation, and computer applications. This course is scheduled with <em>Media Technology 1</em> to make a full-year program.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Mechanical Movement</h4>
						<span>Mr. Potzer</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits - Grade 9</small>
						<p>This course is aimed at students who want to make their own automated devices. It will be useful to people who want to make any sort of mechanical toy/sculpture/device. It will help a student understand the practical basics of mechanisms. Students will learn the history and principles of movement, design, control, and construction of automated systems.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Media Technology 1</h4>
						<span>Mr. Fenlon</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits</small>
						<p>This course will offer students a basic hands-on approach to the technical processes and operations necessary to produce videotapes. Techniques will include camera operation, script writing, lighting, editing, and directing. Introduction to computer generated graphics and editing will also be included. This course is scheduled with <em>Engineering Technology 1</em> to make a full-year program.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Power, Energy, and Transportation Technology 1</h4>
						<span>Mr. Drelick</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits - Grades 9-12</small>
						<p>Concerned about rising fuel costs? Interested in how or if alternative fuels will affect our dependence on foreign imports? This course is designed to introduce students to various power, energy, and transportation systems. Power systems, land, and marine transportation technology will be addressed. A heavy emphasis on alternative fuels, including solar, hydrogen, diesel, electric, and ethanol will be discussed. Students will work with simulated, hands-on activities including land, hybrid roving vehicles, small engines, and marine transport systems with the objective of applying acquired knowledge in order to solve real life situations. This is the first level of a planned three level program.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Women in Engineering Design and Technology</h4>
						<span>Mr. Wallace</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits - Grade 9-12</small>
						<p>This course will provide students with knowledge of various fields of engineering and experiences with the engineering process through participation in problem solving and design activities. Studying areas of engineering and then applying the engineering process in order to solve real life problems will provide students with a better understanding of how real world situations are addressed. Many speakers will help motivate the students to consider engineering as a career goal.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Industrial Technology</h3>
				<ul class="info">
					<li>
						<h4>Architecture 1</h4>
						<span>Mr. Kappler</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits - Grade 9-10</small>
						<p>This course will focus on architectural drawing, design, and planning. Students will learn how to use computers and sophisticated software to model building structures. Students will then apply knowledge about basic residential design and planning to create their own “dream home". Students will produce a complete set of detailed architectural drawings and scale model.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Computer Aided Drawing and Design 1 (CADD)</h4>
						<span>Mr. Peltier</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits - Grade 9-12</small>
						<p>This first year course is designed to introduce the students to CAD software as well as hand drafting technique. Units include lettering, dimensioning, the care and use of drafting instruments, sketching, orthographic projection, sectional views, and geometric construction. An introduction to 3 dimensional modeling will also be covered. This series of courses is valuable to many industrial and engineering careers.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Computer Animation</h4>
						<span>Mr. Kappler</span>
						<small>CPA - 5 Credits - Grade 10-12</small>
						<p>This course will introduce students to 3-dimensional computer animation applications. Concepts, relationships between concept and technical skills, and the need to understand the historical development of 3-dimensional computer animation will be emphasized. Exercises will highlight the techniques of creating the illusion of motion and three-dimensional space using computer software. Students will be able to create 2-dimensional art on the computer as well as fully rendered 3-D characters and environments along the lines of “Shrek”. It is recommended that students enrolling in this course be familiar with basic computer functions and computer file management. This class will count towards Practical Art requirement, not Technology requirement. <strong>Prerequisite: Engineering Design Technology 1, Fine Art</strong></p>
