				<h3>TSA 'Webmaster 2010-2011' (High School) Design Brief: <em>Web Accessability for the Visually Impaired</em></h3>
				<h4>I. Context</h4>
				<p>The Internet has become a necessary part of our everyday lives. From news to entertainment to education to communication, we constantly interact with the Internet.</p>
				<p>One hurdle in website design that is often overlooked is the accessibility of the vast resources of the online world to those who are visually impaired. While most with vision may appreciate seeing slick interfaces and flashy graphics, those without vision must experience the world through audible and tactile means. This leaves the latter group of people at a severe disadvantage in the online world.</p>
				<h4>II. Challenge Statement</h4>
				<p>Design a website that displays your research on websites designed to be accessible by the visually impaired. Topics should include, but are not limited to, good design practices, elements of code, federal and industry standards and regulations, and tools available to those with impaired vision for experiencing the World Wide Web. Additionally, consider the various degrees of visual impairments, including color blindness, partial blindness/low vision, and complete blindness.</p>  <p>The design for your TSA chapter and school technology education information need not be created with accessibility in mind. (Go ahead, have fun and impress us with what you can do.) However, your design brief solution should include a working example of the design brief solution content within an accessible design. Provide examples of how various visual elements found online can be presented in a non-visual manner for a visually impaired audience.</p>
				<h4>III. Evaluation</h4>
				<p>Thought should be given to good design practices and cross-platform compatibility. Expect your solution to be evaluated using any combination of Windows XP, Vista and 7, as well as Mac OS X in browsers, including the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Safari.</p>
				<p>Positive evaluations will be given to teams who successfully create a clean, easy to use website that features an excellent presentation of the required content.</p>
				<p>For questions, email event coordinator Stephen Blue at Stephen [at] stephenblue [dot] net. Include the word “WEBMASTER” in the subject line to ensure that the email is received and read.
